For Web developers / Designers / Translators

Each localized version of weusecoins is independent of each other and can contain
html or php, tough html is prefered for performances reasons.

That allows us to adapt anything to best fit each languages requirements and available
ressources, businesses or active groups. That includes the html, fonts, css, scripts, social networks, etc.
And that allows us to update other languages when a translator is missing for a specific language.

materials directory is used as a shared directory to store files that take
more disk space, such as the weusecoins video. 


## How to translate ##

1. Begin, Copy the "en" (english) folder and rename the copy to the ISO 639-1 code for your language.

2. Texts, Open .html files and translate all human readable english dialogs (without touching the html tags like <a> or <div>).

3. Links, Update the name of each .html file so that it reflects your language, and update the links in the .html files accordingly.

4. Fonts, Make sure that all characters in your language are supported by current fonts. Otherwise, find a similar font that works with a licence that allows its use.

5. Images, Update the few images that contain text with some editing software such as Gimp. You might also need to resize some buttons.

6. Social, Specific contents or integrations that make no sense in your language, such as StackExchange, twitter or else. You can choose to keep them with a notice saying that these ressources are not translated, or you can remove, or replace them by whatever you believe will be appropriate as a replacement.

7. Languages, Add a link to your translated version in the <div id="lang"> of all translated versions of weusecoins.com. Not just in your translated version.

8. Contact, Make sure you state on appropriate contexts that emails sent to info@weusecoins.com must be in english.

9. Contributor, You are allowed to put your name and a link in the team page, at the end of the existing translators list.

10. run ./updatesitemap to update sitemap.xml

## What not to do ##

for obvious reasons, you should not change the meaning of any text and you are not allowed to add or change links. Such changes must be discussed first.
You are however allowed to add links to community or news websites in the community section that might be appropriate for each language.


## Using sed for bulk changes ##

When you need to update something in many pages, it is much faster (and less likely to introduce mistakes) to use a sed command line to apply a change to all pages at once.

Example : sed -i 's_src_dst_g' *.html
This allows you to replace all occurence of "src" by "dst" in all .html files in the current directory.


## Keep the same html structure ##

Keep html structure as symetric and perfectly identical as possible between each pages, and each localized version. This should not prevent you to add unique things for some languages. But you can keep the rest exactly as it is.


# Test different browsers ##

If you make any change to the html, javascript or CSS, you should at least your changes with Internet Explorer 7, and a few more browsers.
