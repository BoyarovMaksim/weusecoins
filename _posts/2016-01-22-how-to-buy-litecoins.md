Buying litecoin is not any different from purchasing bitcoins: find a Litecoin exchange, convert your local currency to litecoin, and send the litecoins to your wallet. 

Finding a Litecoin exchange can be difficult because most exchanges don’t sell litecoin directly. In most cases customers must [first purchase bitcoins](/en/how-buy-bitcoins-online-best-bitcoin-exchange-rate-bitcoin-price/) and then trade for litecoin. 

With that said, there are a few exchanges where users can purchase litecoins directly, without buying bitcoins first: 

* **[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)** - Kraken is a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange based in Europe. Kraken offers three Litecoin trading pairs: LTCXBT, LTCUSD, and LTCEUR. In addition, Kraken accepts a number of payment methods--SEPA transfer, USD bank wire, GBP SEPA, Interac Online--which makes buying litecoins easy for Europeans, Americans, and Canadians. 

* **[SnapCard](https://www.snapcard.io/buy-litecoin)** - SnapCard is a US based bitcoin broker. Customers can buy litecoin with a connected US bank account via ACH transfer. 

* **[LitecoinLocal.net](https://www.litecoinlocal.net/)** - LitecoinLocal is similar to LocalBitcoins. Users upload buy/sell ads and can agree on trade terms while using LitecoinLocal as escrow. 


## Trading Bitcoins for Litecoins

If the options above don’t work, the second easiest way to get litecoins is to exchange bitcoins for litecoin. Many Bitcoin exchanges offer this trading pair:
 
* **[BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/)** - BTC-e has the largest amount LTC/BTC trading volume in the world, with over $250,000 average daily volume. BTC-e offers the best exchange rate and only charges 0.2% per trade. 

* **[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)** - Bitfinex is the largest USD/BTC trading site in terms of volume, but also features a LTC/BTC pair. 

* **[Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/)** - An altcoin exchange with $20,000 BTC/LTC daily volume. 

* **[ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.io/)** - Convert bitcoins to litecoins in less than a minute. 

## Completing your Purchase

Leaving your coins on exchange is a risk that has cost Bitcoin users millions of dollars (e.g. Mt. Gox). Once your purchase has been made, send your litecoins to a wallet you control: 

* **[Electrum-LTC](https://electrum-ltc.org/)** is good choice on desktop computers. 
* **[Litecoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet_ltc&hl=en)** is the most popular Android wallet.  
* **[Hive Wallet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hive-wallet/id906990301?mt=8)** supports Litecoin and Bitcoin. 

## Buying Litecoins with PayPal
Although not recommended, it’s possible to buy litecoins with PayPal. First you must buy SLL on [VirWox](https://www.virwox.com?r=fbbb7), then trade SLL for bitcoin. Once you have BTC you can use any of the methods above to trade BTC for litecoin.
